# 2019-11-29 update üçê-to-üçê commons

+ The working group meets weekly on Tuesdays 5-6PM Berlin time. If
you'd like to participate, please let us know on
[p2pcommons-wg@libscie.org](mailto:p2pcommons-wg@libscie.org)

+ If you do or do not like the pear joke, please feel free to send us
an e-mail as well as we like us some :pear: review

+ The `sdk-js` is at `v0.3.1`, which was released last week. We are
primarily trying to figure out the networking of Hyperdrive v10, and
the best way to get a daemon running without duplicating work. See
also our meeting notes
[here](https://github.com/p2pcommons/working-group/blob/master/20191126.md).

+ The module specification has become more stable as of
`v0.3.0`. There's still more work to do on the interoperability
specification, but that is less urgent as that can be overhauled
without lots of backwards incompatibility issues.

+ We have an [ongoing pull
request](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/pull/17) for the text
specification going on, and welcome feedback and thoughts on how to
create an open commons that is permissible but also readable for
everyone.

+ We are working on a better versioning scheme, but the old one can be
found
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hp4gIUVNePO33lGcYeK8dOwY6EZWCQrL7XrURIILslg/edit?usp=sharing)
(if not yet 404'ed).
