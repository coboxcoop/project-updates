# 2019-12-13 update üçê-to-üçê commons

+ The working group has had two meetings since the last update, you can find the minutes for both meetings in the `@p2pcommons/working-group` repository:
  + [2019-12-03](https://github.com/p2pcommons/working-group/blob/master/20191203.md)
  + [2019-12-10](https://github.com/p2pcommons/working-group/blob/master/20191210.md)

+ The module specification (`v0.2.1`) now includes `title` character limits (300 characters; for justification of 300 see [the closed Pull Request](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/pull/20)).

+ For the upcoming [`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js) `v0.3.2` release we integrated
  + [Content versioning (i.e., checkouts of Dat archives)](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/pull/53)
  + [Hyperswarm networking](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/pull/51)

+ We are integrating roadmaps into all the p2pcommons repository's wikis for planning purposes (e.g., [`sdk-js` wiki](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/wiki/Roadmap))

+ We are preparing our design documentation for the peer-to-peer commons and a Hex logo :+1:

+ We will post the next update on 2020-01-10.
