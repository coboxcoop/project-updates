*Specifications for a p2p communication infrastructure for stepwise projects*

- Discussions regarding uniqueness and self-referencing
  - `follows` must not self-reference (i.e., you may not follow yourself)
  - `parents` must not self-reference the current version (i.e., a previous version of content module may be a parent module of a later version)
  - `authors`, `parents`, `follows` and `contents` must not contain duplicates
  - `follows`, `contents` and `parents` may still reference multiple versions of the same module (no change)
