# 2020-01-10 update üçê-to-üçê commons

+ The working group has had two meetings since the last update, you can find the minutes for both meetings in the `@p2pcommons/working-group` repository:
  + [2019-12-17](https://github.com/p2pcommons/working-group/blob/master/20191217.md)
  + [2019-01-07](https://github.com/p2pcommons/working-group/blob/master/20200107.md)

+ The module specification (`v0.2.2`) now includes a recommendation for an `avatar` key/value for profile modules

+ Networking is functional; lots of the `hyperdrive` dependencies are in flux so we're keeping track with the work from Hyperdivision

+ Released `v0.3.4` of the [`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/releases/tag/v0.3.4)
