# `p2pcommons` (aka üçê-to-üçê commons)

Description: A set of specifications to make a peer-to-peer commons
([`@p2pcommons/specs`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs). These
specifications define a class of Dat archives, with specific metadata,
resulting in what we call modules on the Dat network. These modules
can either be of type content or user profile (i.e., we do not store
content and profile in the same place, like for example Fritter did).

We are building an SDK to implement these specifications and make
application development easier
([`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js). We also
have a working group that develops the specifications further
([`@p2pcommons/working-group`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/working-group)).
This is aimed to be a base layer, for interoperable applications to be
built on top of. One of those is
[Hypergraph](../hypergraph/README.md).

The people involved can be found
[here](https://github.com/orgs/p2pcommons/people).
