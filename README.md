# Project Updates
Updates from the various projects working on or with dat.

## Purpose
This repository was initiated through conversations in the Dat Consortium about wanting to improve communications between the various projects using and contributing to the dat ecosystem. 

Its aim is to help projects keep themselves and others up to date. Please direct people interested in dat's projects here :)

## Projects 
* [Cabal](cabal/README.md), a peer-to-peer group chat written with dat's primitives
* [Beaker Browser](beaker-browser/README.md), an experimental p2p Web browser

## Contributing
If you have a project using dat, or you're a person involved with dat somehow, 
see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to get started.
