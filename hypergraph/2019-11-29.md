# 2019-11-29 update for Hypergraph

+ We are very near a `v0.3.0` of the `cli`, which allows users to
create profile modules, content modules, and will allow users to
register content to profiles (in the form of versioned Dat keys).

+ We started some work on including an editor directly into
Hypergraph, based on the Wax editor from the Coko Foundation. Work on
this started in the
[`@hypergraph-xyz/editor`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/editor/)
repository.

+ As we redo the versioning scheme, we'll also get a better roadmap
for the Hypergraph applications into the next weeks. We'll post a link to the updated roadmap in the next update :+1:
