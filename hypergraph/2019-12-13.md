# 2019-12-13 update Hypergraph

+ We integrated the Wax editor into the `@hypergraph-xyz/cli` ([original PR here](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli/pull/58)), which now allows users to edit HTML content in a WYSIWYG manner. This is an example of how it looks:

+ We integrated a module previewer, which is inspired by academic publications. An example:

+ Our [`v0.3.0` PR](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli/pull/56) is unblocked for some final work, because of [the networking and checkout improvements in the `@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](../p2pcommons/2019-12-13.md). We aim the `v0.3.0` release to come before Christmas :confetti_ball:

+ The initialisation of a module was taking long, so we integrated a spinner to give feedback to users that the `cli` isn't timing out.

+ All Hypergraph roadmaps are being integrated into their respective repository's. They are not fully fleshed out yet but are getting there.

+ We started design work on the [`@hypergraph-xyz/desktop`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop), and are discussing some initial wireframes before Christmas. An initial release will include a start at onboarding and the module feed. Here's a photo of some of our brainstorming :)

+ We will post the next update on 2020-01-10.
