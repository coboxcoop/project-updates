# Ara

Ara is a set of decentralized, open source software tools that handle real-world, user-level functionality in online identity, content distribution, and rights management.
Ara directly connects creators and fans, enabling delivery and payment without a traditional centralized platform, and thus avoiding platform censorship and fees.
Additionally, platforms can integrate Ara tools to save bandwidth costs, improve transparency around rights and payment, and reward their users for contributing their hardware and their attention.

To try out Ara yourself, download the [Ara File Manager](https://github.com/AraBlocks/ara-file-manager).
There, you can make an ARAid, publish your digital content, sell it with the ARA token, buy content from other creators, and seed content to earn rewards.
Ara is truly decentralized; with the Ara File Manager, your machine is participating directly in peer distribution swarms and the blockchain.

Under the hood, the Ara File Manager is an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) app that puts a graphical user interface on the [Ara modules](https://github.com/AraBlocks/), written in [Node](https://nodejs.org/).
[Dat](https://dat.foundation/) components make up the peer delivery, and ARA is an ERC-20 token using [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/).
ARAid and `ara:` links follow the [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) spec.
