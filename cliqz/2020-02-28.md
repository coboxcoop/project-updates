## Cliqz 1.33 with Dat support

We released Cliqz desktop browser [1.33](https://cliqz.com/en/download) with experimental Dat support. This can
be enabled from the browser settings at `about:preferences#experiments`. Dat
support is based off the [dat-webext](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/dat-webext)
browser extension.
