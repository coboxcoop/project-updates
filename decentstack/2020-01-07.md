Happy new year everyone, I'm excited to present a new tool in the decentstack org.

### **HyperSimulator**
[https://github.com/decentstack/hyper-simulator](https://github.com/decentstack/hyper-simulator)

> It should enable you to quickly test your application during semi-realistic swarm conditions.

I'm still researching efficiency and time-complexity given multiple-feed replication in big swarms.

And in order to create miniture models of the problem I've written the simulator
that allows you to spawn a number of peers with individual behaviour and properties.

The simulation yields an `ndjson` log file that can be indexed and analyzed in Kibana or any other log-analysis tools.
_(No user privacy violated in the production of these analytics :tm:)_

The example scenario only uses a plain hypercore feed, which in itself isn't that interesting unless you enjoy on watching blocks being replicated throughout a swarm.

In order to get anything useful out the swarm-log you should emit your own application metrics.
By default the simulation only reports bandwidth consumption and connection information.
