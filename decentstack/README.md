# Decentstack

Microframework for building kappa architecture dapps compatible
with kappa-core.

It started out as an rewrite of [multifeed](https://github.com/kappa-db/multifeed/) redesigned to minimize racing conditions and a rework of internal error-handling.
But is now heading towards also serving as an alternative replication
manager for kappa-core applications.
