# datdot

**a p2p alternative to hashbase.io for hypercores** ([more details](https://hackmd.io/@serapath/BkAx8J8cH#/))
1. you can download a system tray electron app to start offering your disk space to the network.
2. you can also ask the network to seed your hypercores (e.g. dat/hypertrie/hyperdrive/....)
3. the network includes logic to automatically measure ratios to prevent people from abusing it
4. the network encourages people to whitelist trusted peers and exclude them from participating in the auto-measured ratio system

**please tell us what you think - we appreciate all feedback & suggestions :-)**
