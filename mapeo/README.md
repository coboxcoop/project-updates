# Mapeo

Mapeo is a free digital toolset for documenting, monitoring, and mapping many
types of data. MAPEO is a local-first open-source technology which makes it
easy for many to use. No internet or special hardware required to collect,
view, or share data.  

Mapeo is currently deployed in 12 project areas across Guyana, Ecuador,
Colombia, Panama, Vietnam and Peru, involving over 100 local communities.

With the push of a button, contributors can gather map data by linking GPS
points, photos, and notes. All data is completely owned by the communities
themselves. And a simple and adaptive interface makes it accessible for many
different people to use. 

We are building MAPEO in close collaboration with indigenous partners in the
Amazon, including Achuar, Cocama, Kofan, Harakambut, Kichwa, Siekopai,
Wapichana and Waorani peoples. Our partner organizations include indigenous
federations & alliances like Alianza Ceibo, ECA-RCA, PUINAMUDT and South
Central People's Development Organisation, as well as NGO partners including
Amazon Frontlines, Forest Peoples Programme, Gaia Amazonas Rainforest
Foundation US and Witness. Technical partners include Mapbox, Development Seed,
the Dat Foundation and more. For more on Digital Democracy's partners, visit

The development of MAPEO has been made possible due to generous grants from the
Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Knight Foundation, Abundance Foundation, All Eyes
on the Amazon (Dutch Postcode Lottery), and Samsung Next Zero.
